> Sample Efficient Reinforcement Learning (RL), Transfer Learning for RL and real-world application of RL, Climate Change and air pollution

I am a second year Ph.D. student in Statistics at University of Michigan. I am fortunate to work with Professor Ambuj Tewari. Before joining University of Michigan, I obtained my B.S. degree in Data Science from Peking University in 2018.

My current research interests are on Sample Efficient Reinforcement Learning (RL), Transfer Learning for RL and real-world application of RL.

In the first year of Ph.D., I studied sample complexity of perturbation algorithm for RL, as a new randomized exploration method, which is closer to that we use in empirical studies. I proved the first worst-case regret guarantee for this class of methods.

Apart from theoretical studies, I collaborated with a finance team to release a new machine learning dataset, StockNet, the largest cross-market stock dataset designed for machine learning study. I also working with chemists to apply RL on molecular conformation problem, where I trained agents to achieve lowest-energy structure of a given molecule.

At Peking University advised by Professor Songxi Chen, I studied the climate change and its impacts on air pollution usinig hypothesis testinig in North China area.
