> Data, Machine learning, Statistics, Deep Learning

Hey, I am Ziping Xu, student in Peking University major in Data Science. 



I am interested in techniques of data science including deep learning, statistics and visualization. Willing to try all the excting and challenging things and love computer technologies. I have done some research in Air Pollution and some projects in Visualization and Generative Adversarial Nets.  



My brief is that with data we could better and deeper understand the world. I want to devote myself in developing models and softwares for processing and analysing data.



Graphic design and baseball are also my hobbies. You can find some of my works in [PROJECTS](https://zipingxu.github.io/projects/).



Open for everyone who wants to communicate with me! My email is [pkuluke@gmail.com](pkuluke@gmail.com).
