## Biography [[CV](https://github.com/ZipingXu/ZipingXu.github.io/blob/master/ZipingXu.pdf)]

> Machine learning; Hypothesis testing; Visualization; Deep learning

I am a fourth year undergraduate student in Yuanpei College at Peiking University, major in data science by [Prof. Chen Songxi](http://songxichen.gsm.pku.edu.cn/index.php/Index/User) at Peking University and Iowa State University.

I have been working on application of data science and statistics on environmental problems. My past work involves in non-parametric model for air quality diagnose and high dimensional testing for climate change on grided data. I am also interested in data viualization and interpretation of machine learning algorithms. Details of my project could be find at [PROJECT](https://zipingxu.github.io/projects/).

I have a strong ability on computer science and am able to implement experments quickly.
