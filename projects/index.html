							<time>2019</time>
							<ul>
								<li>
    							Methods that add random perturbations to estimates before making decisions were first introduced in online learning where they called FTPL (Follow the Perturbed Leader) methods. These methods, including posterior sampling method, obtain the robustness by conducting random exploration with a explicit randomness.
    							In this paper, we apply this type of perturbation to the design of reinforcement learning algorithm. We provide the first worst-case regret bound for a perturbation algorithm under the unichain, infinite horizon, tabular setting. We believe this study provides a new direction for the analysis of non-optimistic exploration. We also hope that our work further strengthens the connections between optimization and reinforcement learning.

							<h2 id="boxoffice">Meteorological Change and Impacts on Air Pollution -- Results from North China</h2>
							<time>2019</time>
							<ul>
								<li>
									North China has been experiencing severe air pollution and  there are suspicions that  the problem was the acts of climate change in general and a decreasing northerly wind  in particular.
									We take a retrospective approach to analyze 38 years (1979-2016) historic climate data from European
									Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) in conjunction with ground level PM2.5 in 32 cities to quantify effects of the climate variables on the concentration of PM2.5. The study has detected statistically significant changes in the surface temperature, relative humidity and boundary layer structures  and integrated vertical  wind profiles in the region over the 38 years span. It is found that these changes have actually led to reduced PM2.5 in most cases.
									Hence, the climate change has not aggravated the air pollution situation in North China.

							<h2 id="boxoffice">Health Effects of Air Pollution in China</h2>
							<time>Jul 2018</time>
							<ul>
								<li>
									Rapid economic and social development in China has resulted in severe air pollution and consequent adverse impacts on society. The health effects of air pollution have been widely studied.

									Using information from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) database, we established a hierarchical linear model combining pollution and socioeconomic and psychosocial variables to examine the effects of air pollution on public health in China. Local air pollution was characterized in multiple dimensions.
								</li>
								<li>
									The relationship of health to its determinants greatly differed between Eastern and Central/Western China. Higher education, higher income level, better life satisfaction, and long-term marriage were significantly associated with better health status among Chinese. In addition, regional healthcare resources were positively associated with the health of residents. As indicated by the hierarchical model with health as dependent variable, in Central/Western China, longest duration of good air quality in spring/summer was positively associated with health (estimated coefficient = 0.067, standard error = 0.026), while the mean Air Quality Index (AQI) in autumn/winter was inversely associated with health (estimated coefficient = −0.082, standard error = 0.031). Good air quality in the current study is defined as daily average AQI less than 35.
								</li>
								<li>
									Duration (in days) of acceptable air quality was particularly important for improving public health. Future policies should target increased duration of good air quality while managing air pollution by controlling or decreasing severe air pollution.

							<h2 id="boxoffice">Cautionary tales on air-quality improvement in Beijing</h2>
							<time>Sep 2017</time>
							<ul>
								<li>
									The official air-quality statistic reported that Beijing had a 9.9% decline in the annual concentration of PM2.5 in 2016. While this statistic offered some relief for the inhabitants of the capital, we present several analyses based on Beijing's PM2.5 data of the past 4 years at 36 monitoring sites along with meteorological data of the past 7 years.
								</li>
								<li>
									The analyses reveal the air pollution situation in 2016 was not as rosy as the 9.9% decline would convey, and improvement if any was rather uncertain. The paper also provides an assessment on the city's PM2.5 situation in the past 4 years.
