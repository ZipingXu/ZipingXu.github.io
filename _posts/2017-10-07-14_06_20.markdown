# First Day

This is my first day in my blog!

It has been a long time since I wanted to start my own blog, since I really need some where to record some notes and write some words. Besides, for those who want to know me, this site comes as a platform showing my projects and thoughts.

Thanks ``Ziyi`` for coming up a name for my blog, Zipping. It is a combination of my name ``Ziping`` and ``zip``.

Zipping is based on ``Github Page`` and ``Jekyll``. Template is from [Hux](http://huangxuan.me). It's a wonderful template with tags and categories.
