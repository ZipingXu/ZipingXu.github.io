# Latex Reference

## Steps

1. Copy the Google scholar cite text into a file with a suffix called ``.bib``.
2. In your ``.tex`` file, cite the reference and configure the file, which will generate a ``.aux`` file.
3. Open terminal in the directory and enter  ``bibtex + file_name``, which will generate ``.bbl`` file.
4. Configure ``.tex`` file again, you will get the final output.

## Reference tables, figures or sections

```latex
% table and figure
\label{type:example}
~\ref{type:example}
```
